h1. Bigdesk

Live charts and statistics for Elasticsearch cluster.

|_. Bigdesk |_. Elasticsearch |
| master | 0.20.0 -> 0.20.x |
| 2.0.0 | 0.19.x -> 0.20.x |
| 1.0.0 | 0.17.x -> 0.18.x |

Note: Support of Elasticsearch v0.90.x may not be perfect now, better support is coming soon.

h3. Installation

In order to install the plugin, simply run: <code>bin/plugin -install lukas-vlcek/bigdesk</code> for master version.

To get specific version of Bigdesk use:  <code>bin/plugin -install lukas-vlcek/bigdesk/1.0.0</code>

For example, if you are running ES node on <code>localhost:9200</code> then you can navigate your browser to <code>http://localhost:9200/_plugin/bigdesk/</code> and Bigdesk will auto connect to existing node.

You can also checkout Bigdesk into your local harddrive (or download and extract zip from github) and simply use it by opening <code>index.html</code> in your favorite web browser.

h3. How to use Bigdesk

Once you open Bigdesk in your web broswer, you need to <b>point it to the Elasticsearch node REST endpoint</b>. For example if you run Elasticsearch locally the REST endpoint would be <code>http://localhost:9200/</code> by default. In Bigdesk <b>master</b> you can simply specify any endpoint URL in the text field on top of the screen. If you are using Bigdesk <b>1.0.0</b> (ie. you want to connect Bigdesk to elasticearch 0.17.x - 0.18.x) then you need to fill into two different text fields. First you specify <code>hostname</code> of the Elasticsearch node into the first text field and its <code>port</code> number into the second text field (but in some situations this can be limiting, for example if you run Elasticsearch behind firewall).

Then you hit <code>Connect</code> button (it is called <code>GO!</code> button in Bigdesk 1.0.0) and that's it.

Now you should see cluster name and list of its nodes. You can switch between nodes in the cluster, new nodes are added and old nodes are removed automatically on the fly.

You can change the Bigdesk <b>refresh interval</b> and <b>amount of data</b> that is displayed by charts.

h3. URL parameters

If you are using <b>Bigdesk 1.0.0</b> you can immediately connect to a particular host, add the <code>host</code>, <code>port</code>, and <code>go</code> parameters to the query string: <code>index.html?host=search.example.com&port=9200&go</code>

If you are using <b>Bigdesk master</b> you can use any of the following URL parameters to immediately connect to a particular host or set history or refresh interval:
* <code>endpoint</code> = URL of ES node REST endpoint (you might want to use URL encoded value). Defaults to <code>http://localhost:9200</code>.
* <code>refresh</code> = refresh interval in milliseconds. Defaults to <code>2000</code> (2 sec).
* <code>history</code> = number of milliseconds to keep in history. Defaults to <code>300000</code> (5 min).
* <code>connect</code> = if set to <code>true</code> Bigdesk will try to connect immediately to the endpoint. Defaults to <code>false</code>.

Example connecting to <code>http://127.0.0.1:9201</code> with 3 sec refresh interval:

<code>index.html?endpoint=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9201&refresh=3000&connect=true</code>
